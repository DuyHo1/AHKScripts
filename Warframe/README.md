These scripts are for a game called warframe. They are simple macros for execution of actions that would otherwise be arthritis-inducing.

autoSlide.ahk
This is the script for continuous slide attacks (can be toggled on and off), designed specifically for the Atterax modded with Berserker, but could be used for any weapon with some tweaking. As Berserker builds up attack speed, the slide attack can be performed more rapidly, so this script includes hotkeys to increase and decrease the script's attack speed.
hotkeys:
` (the tilda key above tab): toggle the auto-slide attacks on and off.
]: increase attack speed. feel free to mash this, as a limit is in place to prevent it from attacking faster than the weapon can handle
[: decrease attack speed. also has a limiter in place

jumpAttack.ahk
This is the script for a continuous jump-attack specifically designed for the Ohma modded with Berserker. Given this weapon's devastating capabilities when jump-attacking, this was worth making, but doesn't have much use outside of Ohma thus far. As with autoSlide.ahk, you can toggle it on and off as well as increase or decrease the frequency of attack execution depending on the amount of berserker stacks. 
hotkeys:
` (tilda key above tab): toggle auto-attacks on or off
+: increase attack speed. feel free to mash this, as a limit is in place to prevent it from attacking faster than the weapon can handle
-: decrease attack speed. also has a limiter in place
