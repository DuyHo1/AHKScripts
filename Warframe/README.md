These scripts are for a game called warframe. They are simple macros for execution of actions that would otherwise be arthritis-inducing.

**autoSlide.ahk**<br /> 
This is the script for continuous slide attacks (can be toggled on and off), designed specifically for the Atterax modded with Berserker, but could be used for any weapon with some tweaking. As Berserker builds up attack speed, the slide attack can be performed more rapidly, so this script includes hotkeys to increase and decrease the script's attack speed.

*hotkeys:*<br /> 
&#96; (the tilda key above tab): toggle the auto-slide attacks on and off.<br /> 
]: increase attack speed. feel free to mash this, as a limit is in place to prevent it from attacking faster than the weapon can handle<br /> 
[: decrease attack speed. also has a limiter in place<br /> 


**jumpAttack.ahk**<br /> 
This is the script for a continuous jump-attack specifically designed for the Ohma modded with Berserker. Given this weapon's devastating capabilities when jump-attacking, this was worth making, but doesn't have much use outside of Ohma thus far. As with autoSlide.ahk, you can toggle it on and off as well as increase or decrease the frequency of attack execution depending on the amount of berserker stacks. 

*hotkeys:*<br /> 
&#96; (tilda key above tab): toggle auto-attacks on or off<br /> 
+: increase attack speed. feel free to mash this, as a limit is in place to prevent it from attacking faster than the weapon can handle<br /> 
-: decrease attack speed. also has a limiter in place<br /> 

**autoCrafter.ahk**<br /> 
With this script you can walk away from your keyboard and it will keep crafting those pesky 1-minute recipes in your foundry (i.e. derelict keys, 10x energy restores, 10x air support charges, 10x ciphers, etc.)
note: This is made for 1920x1080 resolution. If your resolution is different, this will not work for you.<br /> <br /> 

DISCLAIMER: Use this at your own risk. I've optimized the script to be as safe as possible in afk mode, so in ideal afk conditions this script should never use plat for rushing; accidental or otherwise. However, if this does happen, due to external stimulus or otherwise, I am not responsible for the plat you lose due to rushing. I will not compensate you, and I will not be held accountable for your decision - the act of using this script is yours and yours alone.<br /> <br /> 

When you run the script, you will get a GUI with a bunch of checkboxes and a slider. <br />
The 6 checkboxes at the top of the GUI represent the 6 visible items that you see when you open the foundry. So in order to craft items, you simply navigate through your foundry until they are present on the screen, then check off the corresponding checkbox(es) in the GUI. The following screenshot indicates the correlation:<br />

The slider enables you to choose how many times you wish for the script to craft the item in question. If you want it to run until you've depleted your resources, just check off the "infinite" checkbox.<br /><br />

As I mentioned in the disclaimer above, I will not be held responsible for any loss of plat or other damages, and I will not compensate you either. As such, I recommend that you supervise the automation for the first few runs to ensure that it runs smoothly.
